A utility library for working with word-level speech-to-text timestamps. The main goal is to simplify working with timestamps generated by openai's whisper model with "word" timestamp_granularities.

## Features
- Realign word timestamps with full text
- Merge several transcriptions together
- (Optional dependency) Split long audio into smaller segments by moments of silence.

## Installation

```bash
pip install stt-utils
```

With audio tools support:

```bash
pip install "stt-utils[audio]"
```
